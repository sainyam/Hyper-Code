To find the tuple (compute all the pwd), in each tupple on top k (c)

definition for function (c)

Hyper apporach, 

modfiy top k to ranking k

Optimize backdoor(c)

Backteria need to calcualte (pick r1,r5,r7)
Pr(r1>theta1,r5>theta1,r7>theta1|given updates)
r is the row (c) (fix)

multiple query tok, compare this to another aproach (greedy one)

Pt(t_i,D) > Pr(t_j,D) for all j > k and I<=k

1:30-2:30 east time
10:30-11:30

Pr(r1 > theta and r2<theta)

$\sum Pr(top k |backdoor) Pr(backdoor)$

$Pr(backdoor)$ is missing (to do)

marginal prob of each tupple, each tuple is 0 or close to 0 should be filtered out(without this and with this) (to do) 

compare this to the greedy approcah(to do), verify the answer is same
